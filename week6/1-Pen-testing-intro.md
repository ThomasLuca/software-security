# Penetration Testing: Introduction

Penetration Testing accesses security by trying to find exploitable vulnerabilities (evidence of insecurities).

Pentesting is mostly done by __black hat__ hackers without malicious intent.

It's done on all layers of technology

* program
* complete application
* network

## Who and how?

Mostly teams that use automating tools to find security issues. Sometimes this team also gets some prior knowledge about the system before attacking it.

## History

* 1967: Time sharing enabled multiple users to access a computer at the same time. This caused security threads. They used the term "penetration" for the first time in the ware report.
* 1970: US government hired penetration testing teams.
* Today: Security testing happens by large companies, organizations als also individuals.

## Benefits of pentesting

* Penetrations are __certain__ and __reproducible__.
  * No false alarms
  * Not hypothetical
  * Applied to a whole component
* Feel good factor
  * Results in clear improvement to security
  * Produces evidence of real vulnerabilities

## Drawbacks

* Absence of penetrations is not evidence of security
  * Fixing vulnerabilities does not mean that none are left
  * Some problems may be overlooked
* System needs to be retested when changes are made

Penetration testing is still worth doing.
