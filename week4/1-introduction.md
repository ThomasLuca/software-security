# Designing and Building Secure Software: Introduction

The best approach is to build security in right from the start.

## Development process

The development process has four common phases:

* Requirements
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing/assurance

Security engineering fits in all of these phases.  
security engineering activities:

* Security Requirements
* Abuse Cases
* Architectural risk analysis
* Security-oriented design
* Code review
* Risk-based Security Testing
* Penetration Testing

## Software vs Hardware

__Software is malleable__ and easily changed

* Advantageous to core functionality
* Harmful to security

__Hardware is fast__, but hard to change

* Disadvantageous to evolution
* Advantage to security (can't easily be changed or exploited by attacker)

### Secure Hardware

Security features are more often implemented in hardware eg: cryptography instructions, encrypted computation, physically uncloneable functions,...
