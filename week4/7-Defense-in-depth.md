# Design Category: Defense in Depth, Monitoring/Traceability

__Security by diversity__: Don't rely on a single (kind) defense. This can mitigate/prevent an attack

Example:

- Use a firewall to close access on non-web ports
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use type safe language

## Use of community resources

Don't solely depend on yourself but depend on a diversity of people for solving a security problem.

- use community open-source crypto library, made and tested by experts. (also do some testing yourself)
- making a crypto algo open-source (get feedback and fixes from other people). No security by obscurity!
- Stay up-to-date with recent threats and research
