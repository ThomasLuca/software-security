# Web Basics

The web mostly consists of clients an servers.

* Client:
  * Browser
  * (Private) Data
* Server:
  * Web server
  * Database

## Interacting with web servers

Resources are identified by a URL eg: <http://www.blank.org/blank.html>

* http = Protocol
* www.blank.org = Hostname/server
* /blank.html = Path to resource

Path to resource can both be static (eg: index.html) or dynamic (eg: delete.php).

The rest of this chapter won't be summarized because it's nothing new (http, tcp, get/post, status codes).
