# The Web

This week is focussed on internetsecurity. Most of the applications on the web are made with typesafe languages, but they still have other vulnerabilities (eg: SQL injection, XSS, Session Hijacking, CSRF).

These share some common causes with memory safety vulnerabilities; like confusion of code and data.

## Web security outline

1. Web 1.0: Basics
    * SQL injection
2. Web with state
    * Session Hijacking
    * Cross-site Reject Forgery (CSRF)
3. Web 2.0: advent of javascript
    * Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
